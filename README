* Documentation for LCD 1602-A

PDF file (other versions are also available online): https://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/eone-1602a1.pdf

* Powering the display

Refer to the documentation for powering the LCD. Mind the contrast setup via the V0 pin. If contrast is too high or too low you won't be able to see anything. I recommend using a potentiometer of 20 KOhm. For backlight LED some models may be connected directly others may need  a resistor. Find a connection diagram appropriate for your model.  

* Data pins

Refer to the library file LCD1602A.h section "Pin Configuration".
